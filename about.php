        <ul>We the Chieftain Coders here at Shiprock High School are privileged and honored to be a part of the first
        Native American computer coding bootcamp for high school students in Navajo land. The nine of us participated in the
        Cultivating Coders bootcamp to learn how to code from the front end to the back end of web development.
        It does take time to learn like we did, but it is worth the time learning how to code. Some brief time later we
        would start to get the hang of the coding format that we learned from our instructors from Cultivating Coders
        and Cheii's DevShop.

        <ul>The aspiration of learning how to make a website is intricate, because of all the different programing
            languages, that we learn how to make a website more interactive and user friendly.
        </ul>
    <br>
        <ul>Why we're doing coding is to learn the information that would needed to be done to create a websites inside and
        out.
